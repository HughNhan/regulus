Start from fresh workspace:
==========================

1. First step, you should "source botstrap.sh"
2. Next, you should fix the lab.config to match your lab.
3. Third you should decide your custom arguments for your jobs.list.
4. Last you can "make init-jobs; make run-jobs", or "make init-all; make run-all"

Considerations:
	1. Time, Most jobs take 20 minutes, An iperf3 drop-hunter job can take several hours.


Usage scenarios:
================
1. To run one jobs e.g ./1_GROUP/NO-PAO/4IP/INTER-NODE/TCP/16-POD
	cd ./1_GROUP/NO-PAO/4IP/INTER-NODE/TCP/16-POD
	make init
	make run
