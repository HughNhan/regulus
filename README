This is the Regulus workspace, the repo that contains a collection of crucible test 
configurations (./1_GROUP, ./2_GROUP and ./3_GROUP), performance add-on config util 
(./PAO), and SRIOV config util (./SRIOV-config)

The tests are to be run on a Crucible controller.
The PAO and SRIOV_config are to be run on the bastion.

Assumption: 
===========
Your Crucible controller is working correctly with your testbed before,

Running a pilot test on a fresh Regulus workspace:
====================================================
 
1. First, "source ./bootstrap.sh"
2. You should adapt the ./lab.config to match your lab.
3. Add one job to ./jobs.config. Or use the default config which has "./1_GROUP/NO-PAO/4IP/INTER-NODE/TCP/2-POD" job.
4. Next, "make init-jobs; make run-jobs". If lab.config is OK, the job will run to completion.
5. See examine result sections
5. Last, "make clean-jobs"

Considerations:
	1. Time, Most jobs take 20 minutes, An iperf3 drop-hunter job can take several hours.


Testing scenarios:
================
1. To run one job e.g ./1_GROUP/NO-PAO/4IP/INTER-NODE/TCP/16-POD in debug mode
	cd ./1_GROUP/NO-PAO/4IP/INTER-NODE/TCP/16-POD
	make init
	make run 
	make clean	<== clean artifacts and DRY runs, Use rmrun --label to gracefully rm run.

2. To run a number of jobs e.g ./1_GROUP/NO-PAO/4IP/INTER-NODE/TCP/16-POD+2-POD ...  etc in job mode.
	edit the jobs,config to add you job into the $JOBS list
	make init-jobs
	make run-jobs
	make clean-jobs

2. To run all jobs under Regulus. Warning it can take multi hours if not days.
	make init-all
	make run-all
	make clean-all

Examine results
=================
	cd to job/test dir e.g ./1_GROUP/NO-PAO/4IP/INTER-NODE/TCP/16-POD.
	you should find th result and all artifects in latest dir
	
Configure PAO and SRIOV
=======================
Assuming you have pulled this repo on your bsstion.
You should config PAO and SRIOV at the necessary time. The reason being, a test 
means to be run in non-PAO env, should not be run after PAO has been configured,  

Similarly, SRIOV can also impact the number of queues of the PF. So non SRIOV tests 
may be impacted by SRIOV config even though the test does not use SRIOV.


Customization:
==============
You can changes many things in:
./lab.config
./jobs.config
./templates/...
