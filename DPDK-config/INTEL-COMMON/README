This dir is the common dir for INTEL NIC types.
**** Do not **** invoke ./install.sh and ./clean.sh directly from here.

In the normal usage, from the REGULUS controller, "cd $REG_ROOT/SETUP-group/DKDK && make run"
Or 
If you are on the bastion, for a specific NIC_TYPE i.e CX6, XXV710,E810 etc, cd to THE PARENT DIR of this dir, 
and invoke "bash NIC_TYPE/EAST/{install.sh,cleanup.sh}" directly.
